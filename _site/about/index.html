      <p>there are things that need to be said.<br>
i'm lucky to have a voice with which to say them.</p>

<h2>the garden</h2>
<p>i've never been a huge fan of social media. it is powerful, and an incredible force for good, but man things with infinite scroll aren't great for brains like mine.</p>
<p>and my art follows my stream of consciousness. sometimes that takes the form of poetry. or song. or spoken word, or rhetoric, the odd book or video.</p>
<p>the way we're taught to market runs against the way i create. i often have no idea where particular pieces are leading me until i've arrived; and if i wait until i know where i've gotten to start giving you directions, i'll never release anything (which has been my curse for years).</p>
<p>so instead, this website is my garden. as i create new pieces, they'll be published here immediately. once i figure out where it's going, i create a <a href="/projects">project</a> to start harvesting the work. once it's ready to release, it's released — no muss, no fuss.</p>
<p>feel free to <a href="/follow">join the newsletter</a>.</p>

<h2>about me</h2>
<p>i live in philly. i've been a <a href="/collections/music">musician</a> my whole life. i ran <a href="//cipherprime.com">cipher prime</a> for twelve years, making super-artsy games — did some <a href="/collections/talks">talks</a>, won some awards.</p>
<p>i thought i might be able to put my skills to more direct use helping my community. so in 2020 i joined the <a href="//inquirer.com">philadelphia inquirer</a> as an interactive story developer.</p>
<p>it's been a <a href="//article">trip</a>.</p>
