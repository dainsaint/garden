**midnight** was three, of course  
he had to be  
a quick black triangle  
darting out the door  
almost as fast as my mother did  
earlier that year  

i didnt blame him  
if my legs could carry me as swiftly  
i would have run just as readily  
just as unprepared  
into a world so quick  
to extinguish excitement  

the police would come  
accusing us as we buried him  
flashlights and guns  
so eager to extinguish my grief  
that i forgot i had any  
left only with a box-shaped hole  

**daybreak** was twenty, of course  
midnight's sister  
crushed over and over by time  
and mistreatment  
and illness  
it was miracle she survived at all  

when she re-entered my care  
and her womb ruptured  
she was as surprised as i was  
that she remained alive  
that having attention paid to her  
was all she needed to stay  

and so through sickness  
and blindness  
and fear  
she held tight to life  
knowing herself lucky  
to have anything to hold at all  

**dusk** was fifteen, of course  
clever, and friendly  
and too sweet, by far  
such that he could not abide  
his own sweetness  
so we managed it for him  

not content to be extinguished  
or to be ignored  
he took up space in a way i envied  
voiced desire in a way i lacked  
gave affection in a way i admired  
made the loudness of his existence known  

he made each of his nine lives felt  
each of his eight miracles  
and went without question  
with no box-shaped hole  
or tightly-held fear to hold him  
slipping away as peacefully as his namesake  

and still,  
we have **dawn**
