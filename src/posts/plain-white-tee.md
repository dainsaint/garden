wanted to write something that made me feel the way india.arie’s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq86e4Fhja0) did when I first heard it. first music video I ever filmed, and it was a silly, good time—even though looking back now, it feels more silly than good. One day I’ll stop being embarassed by my past self.
