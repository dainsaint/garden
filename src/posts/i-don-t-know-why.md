i don't know why  
the chemicals knit  
to form that first blushing mango  
take me home in an instant

or why i feel more at ease  
in the gentle rocking  
of a commuter train  
than i do in my home  
  
>
  
i don't know why  
the line of your jaw  
or the smoke in your eyes  
make me knit letters into words

or why i would hang my heart  
like a lantern before my doorway  
bruised by the elements  
but beating louder than in my chest

>

i don't know why  
i hate praise, but crave it  
hate love, but need it  
need touch, but fear it

or why i choose to shine  
incandesent  
yet still view myself  
a moth

>

i don't know why  
i like what i like  
hate what i hate  
love who i love  
  
but i know i do  
and that's enough
