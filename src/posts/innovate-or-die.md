somehow

a poor white mother patches her sons shoes with   
linoleum tiles and

a poor asian mother turns last nights rice into  
todays congee and

a poor black mother folds a twenty in the shape of  
christmas morning and

somehow

silicon valley is the **peak**  
of innovation

you were clever like me”_
