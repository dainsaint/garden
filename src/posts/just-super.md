A boy was bitten by a spider<br/>
The venom was paralyzing<br/>
His therapist recommended yoga and dance<br/>
Heâ€™s now more flexible than ever before<br/>

A boy was blinded by an accident<br/>
Noises became too much, but his faith gives him strength<br/>
His father sued the truck company for negligence<br/>
He just got into law school<br/>

A woman feels invisible<br/>
Her brother is temperamental, her husband stretched too thin<br/>
Their closest friend pretends to be stoic to hide his depression<br/>
But together, they are still a family<br/>

A boy was adopted by American parents<br/>
His foreign roots gave him perspective<br/>
He loves this country<br/>
He works as a journalist, now<br/>

A boy lost his parents to crime<br/>
He used his inheritance to found youth centers<br/>
He feels much better, now<br/>
But at night, the bats still haunt his dreams<br/>
