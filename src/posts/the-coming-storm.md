red, and blue  
yellow, and green  
tell me again  
how the waters rose

> 

the screen tells a story  
a mottled spectrum  
bright yellows and greens  
as the stormfront rolls in  
_bright yellows and greens  
as the stocks rise_

> 

bright reds and blues  
fighting in texas  
the mottled gray of  
an ultrasonic battleground  
transparent tears falling  
like so much bad weather

> 

did you know, then?  
the bright yellows and greens  
of the bp logo  
flowering with thoughts and prayers  
they refuse to answer themselves

> 

did you know, then?  
the reds and blues  
of cable news tribalism  
legitimizing thoughts and prayers  
as a method of governance

> 

of course we knew  
in the same way  
a tapeworm  
knows the good times  
can't last forever

> 

red, and blue  
yellow, and green  
tell me again  
how the waters rose
