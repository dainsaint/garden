<p>last night was mlk<br>
last night i had a dream<br>
this morning had a nightmare<br>
that my dream was yet unseen<br>
i hear voices in my heart<br>
i dont know what they mean<br>
but i understand the truth<br>
yes i understand the scene</p>
<p>yes i understand the amazon<br>
understand that Amazon<br>
understand the ancient days of planning in advance are gone<br>
understand the bassline in the back of my dreamlands are gone<br>
take my hand and show me that the days of my romance are gone</p>
<p>woke up with a bassline that i sold to comcast for a dime<br>
heard them play it back to me online for dollar ninety-nine<br>
sickness in my chest is back<br>
sickness in my heart is black<br>
black is not the sickness its the witness to the sickness<br>
its the nurse the judge the jury<br>
but this jury's hung with fury</p>
<p>last night was mlk<br>
last night i had a dream<br>
this morning had a nightmare<br>
that i was too blind to see<br>
the sickness in my chest that says i am too old too weak<br>
the sickness in my mind that says to wake up to defeat<br>
but who wants to stay woke when i can dream</p>
<p>put me on repeat<br>
put me on instagram<br>
put me inside another box<br>
to make all your demands<br>
the voices in my head are back<br>
voices in my head are black<br>
saul and james and all the names<br>
that spilled their ink up on this track</p>
<p>now i'm flowing mentally<br>
think environmentally<br>
penmanship is dying my handwriting aint whats meant to be<br>
but chicken scratch is braver than the ascii that i labor with<br>
and labor is the saviour that has left its marx on all our kids<br>
kids in gig economies<br>
kids that love astrology<br>
kids make no apologies<br>
these kids that love technology<br>
now im not from the streets i took a lyft to where i got to be<br>
i'm still another box to tick five stars up my the profit sheet<br>
i was once a—<strong>i was once a</strong>—prophet with a scholarship<br>
trade it all for twenty days on mescaline if dr king acknowledge it</p>
<p>last night was mlk<br>
last night i had a dream<br>
this morning woke up got a pen<br>
to find out what it mean<br>
&quot;open up your mind too far no telling what will take its place&quot;<br>
&quot;do whatever you want son, just be a credit to your race&quot;<br>
man i cried myself to sleep<br>
and i woke up with a scream<br>
cause wants to stay woke when i can dream</p>
