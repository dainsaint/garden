i watched the squirrel dart out  
trying to reach the playground  
the only piece of grass and tree  
we had left for it in the city  
only to be struck  
killed by an indifferent machine

>

i sat stunned, for hardly a second  
before the car behind me  
beeped impatiently  
(places to be)

>

what is this story  
we choose to live in  
where a senseless death  
is so commonplace  
as to be an inconvenience
