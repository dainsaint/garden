child,

_dance_

_dance_ like the first one to  
hear the depths of her own  
heartbeat and call it **music**  
liberation through rhythm reclamation

_dance_ till the walls shake  
and the ceiling caves in  
and the stars hold you steady  
as you scream your **grief** into the  
endless night

_dance_ until the sun burns itself into  
your glorious crown  
the heat rising with our voices  
in the **dawn**  
we summoned

_dance_ with the humid  
sweat of lovers entwined in the  
sacred business of fucking  
and never forget we create **pleasure**  
before we create life

_dance_ so when the time comes  
to finish the marathon  
your legs are strong enough  
to carry you that one final **step**  
to freedom
