i had one too many conversations with well-meaning white friends asking, "but why are they protesting in _philly_ when this happened in _minneapolis_?"

so many hadn't even heard of the [move bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_MOVE_bombing).

so we set out to create a comprehensive timeline of the history of police brutality against black philadelphians, from the founding of the department to today.

take some time. learn our history.
