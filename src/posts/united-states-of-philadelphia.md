poorest big city in america  
but we rich in spirit  
(and also capital)

see there’s _change_ in these  
couch cushions  
if you just take time to dig

>

we’re just poor in the way  
that sidewalk acorns  
can’t grow leaves

“poor” the way that movie girl  
is “ugly” before her makeover  
(but we stan a bitch in glasses)

>

you might fuck around and  
catch these hands

you might slip and fall and  
find these hands catch you

>

cause brotherly love means we will  
cuss you the fuck out  
if you fuckin up  
_cause we love you_

and brotherly love means when  
these streets take one of ours  
we take to these streets  
_cause we love you_

>

our mascots are neon chaos  
our main exports are “wish a nigga would”  
our national flower is a  
little black girl in beads  
who saw the police think  
they were above these hands  
and raised her voice  
to sing our national anthem:


_“aight, bet”_

>

welcome to  
**phila-  
fuck-around  
and-find-out-  
adelphia**

_(try the pretzels)_
