      <div class="post-content-text">
      <p>A star explodes in my brain and I'm awake. In my nostrils, the smell of steel; in my mouth, the taste of copper. White-hot light sears my eyes; my ears scream as blood rushes through. My joints snap like splintered wood, fingers crackling towards the sky, as wet coughs escape my dry throat.</p>
<p>I'm alive. Fucking Christ, where am I? Cold metal on my back, dry plastic on my legs... I'm naked. Fucking autopsy table? I touch my chest, but there's no incision, no stitches. They didn't cut me open.</p>
<p>What happened? I was at a bar... Sadie's... Meeting someone? The fucking deal... I remember dim lights, damp tables, shitty beer and that cocksuck Guillerme with his yellow eyes and shit-eating grin.</p>
<p>That motherfucker. He poisoned me. Deadly nightshade. &quot;You cross us, you wish you dead, eh?&quot; Now I know what he meant. Nightshade induces paralysis, slows the metabolism, stops the heart. A mask like unto death.</p>
<p>Right. Step one: pants. Step two: beer. Step three: find Guillerme and stab him in the dick.</p>
<p>I try to move and fail, falling off the table and landing in a bloody, naked heap. Every part of me screams out in pain, and under my curses and gasps I hear a sound like wet leather ripping. My insides shift and I grab my side. It's wet with blood, and my head lurches with nausea like the fucking SS goosestepped on my crotch.</p>
<p>For some reason, I think of the day I got my driver's license.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh, fuck!&quot;</p>
<p>Delirious from the pain, I wrap the plastic sheet around me like a towel. I'm leaving bloody handprints everywhere, my gut drooling like a St. Bernard. I find a clipboard attached to the bottom of the table - my last name, blood type, a bunch of fucking acronyms, and what I'm lookin for: OR5. I grab something steel and sharp looking from a caddy and bleed my way into the hallway.</p>
<p>There's arrows and maps on the wall, but I can't make sense of it. I'm losing blood fast, and with it, my balance and my patience. I stumble into what I guess is a break room to the sound of a girl screaming and a mug of coffee breaking. I point whatever it is I'm carrying and bark, &quot;OR Five! Now!&quot;</p>
<p>And she's nodding and walking, and I'm grabbing onto her and bleeding.</p>
<p>Forever happens.</p>
<p>And the operating theatre is treated to a crazed, naked, blood-soaked lunatic shoulder-checking his way into surgery. As I point at the lump of meat in the surgeon's hands, I realize it's time to update my plan.</p>
<p>&quot;Give that back!&quot;</p>
<p>Step zero: Retrieve my liver. I'll need it for step two.</p>
