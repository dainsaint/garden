i have an old bedraggled dog  
i found when he was small  
he does not jump, or dig, or fetch  
he does not play at all

and though this dark companion  
doesn't bring me any joy  
i must, i must take care of him  
this damnable good boy

he dashes through my hallways  
like a beast that's gone insane  
but when i try to walk him  
he's an anchor on a chain

he barks at the most random hour  
and wakes me from my sleep  
he whines for food, but when i feed  
he simply does not eat

when i try to leave my house  
he lays and blocks the way  
he'll stay until i sit with him  
and waste the whole damn day

but as i know him better now  
his pattern's gotten clear  
and all his bad behaviour  
has become, to me, more dear

he ran because in chasing him  
i had to follow suit  
he did not walk because the ground  
was shaking underfoot

he did not eat because the food  
had rotted on the plate  
and when he barked it was because  
i'd _never_ been awake

he blocks the door to keep me  
when i haven't stopped to rest  
he reminds that i've only ever  
tried to do my best

so even though i sometimes wish  
he'd finally leave me be  
i understand the value  
of his brand of loyalty

i have an old bedraggled dog  
i met when i was small  
he stays with me to teach me  
that it's still okay to fall

so when my dark companion  
sees me hide away from joy  
he must, he must take care of me  
this damnable good boy
