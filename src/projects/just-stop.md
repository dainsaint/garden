**just stop** is a book designed to help you change your relationship with time.

imagine having enough time to cross things off lists and enjoy leisurely activities; to no longer hurriedly rush from place to place and jump from task to task, but instead flow through your day with grace and love.

we wrote this book as both a philosophical exploration of time in the 21st century, and a practical guide to nudging your behaviors and perspectives bit by bit. it’s written to help you shift from a place of scarcity to a place of abundance, with the intention of helping you experience time in new ways that open up new possibilities.

**and in the spirt of abundance, we're sharing the book in its entirety online—free.**
if it resonates with you, and you'd like to support us, we also offer a downloadable version in pdf and ebook format.
