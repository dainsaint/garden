_life is short, make every minute count._  
_running late, running behind, running out of time._  
_rise and grind, early bird, not a moment wasted._  
memento moriâ€”_remember that you will die._

_don't waste my time time is money money is power_  
levels of extraction, refinement  
the industrialization of living  
mine an hour and refine it into labour sold   
for a number of dollars that buy you the power to... what?

to feel free?  
in the time you have left?  
in the time you haven't sold?

_no pain, no gain_  
as if a redwood _needed_ trauma to tower.

what else dies on the alter of time?  
_i'll sleep when I'm dead_  
as if the dead wouldn't give everything to sleep, to dream, to rest.  
to lay down in one form and wake up renewed:  
sleep is not death, it is metamorphosis, transformation

sleep is the seed in winter soil  
the rising bread  
the baby in the belly

_remember that you will die_  
did you remember that you will live?

have you never lain with your lover  
and felt a minute stretch into forever?  
what would it feel like to  
make love to  
every  
moment?

i am going to live forever  
i will make love to every moment  
i will ask _can I do this forever?_  
i will no longer strip-mine my time  
i will no longer colonize my time

i will no longer tear up the  
richly watered ferns of my hours  
to steal bauxite from my red earth:  
_it is not sustainable_.

if time were sand, then you would dread the last grain.  
but time is water, and you cannot drain the ocean.

you are going to live forever  
you are going to live forever  
you are going to live forever  
so live
