we spoke in polite whispers  
in hopes it would spur you to act  
to spend a little less  
to care a little more  
but you could not hear above  
the clanging din of  
your slot machine  
could not see us clearly with  
bloodshot eyes

we spoke in clear tones  
in hopes it would move you to act  
to resist a little less  
to feel a little more  
but you turned up the volume  
the white noise of   
your internal narrative  
could not feel us  
gasping for air

we screamed at the top of our lungs  
in hopes it would force you to act  
to speak a little less  
to hear a little more  
but you drowned us  
in your panicked pleas  
for civility  
could not see the depth  
of our courtesy

our thunder roars angry in the distance  
desperate rains flooding the streets  
the climate changes _because_ of you  
the climate changes _in spite_ of you  
and you **sweat**

as the blood-red moon  
hangs in judgement  
over your horizon
