the cancer was there  
at the beginning  
and for the longest time  
we've been addicted to smoking

the chemotherapy **_burns_**

sets fire to the arteries  
burning cancerous and healthy alike  
our hair falls out  
but we beat the cancer back

at least for a while

the cancer remained  
always waiting  
for a chance  
to _s p r e a d_

killing those parts of you  
you never deemed important enough  
to see

we think ourselves cured

we keep smoking

_we can't breathe_

it solves **nothing**  
_but we need to smoke_  
it solves **nothing**  
_it's all we can do to quell the anxiety_  
it solves **nothing**  
_it helps us feel in control_  
it solves **nothing**  
_expensive, nasty, brutish habit_  
_and we spend more on it every year_

we catch a flu  
and have to decide between fighting  
the flu that may kill us soon  
and  
the cancer that kills us every day

the tumours return  
spreading, malignant  
_this far_, we say, _and no farther_

so now it falls to us  
we administer the chemotherapy  
it **_burns_** once more
we _will_ knock this cancer into remission  
again

but if you're tired  
of having your life  
interrupted
by our aggressive course of treatment...

...quit smoking.
