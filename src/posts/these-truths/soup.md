chicken  
carrots and pumpkin  
yam and chocho and green banana  
a handful of allspice  

and a scotch bonnet pepper  
hot enough to remind you  
you are strong enough  
to swallow the sun  

_do we have enough thyme_ i wonder  
watching my mother skim the fat  
as i wait to drink a soup  
thick enough to plant a flag in  

she is humming something long forgotten  
a song she was taught by a spirit in a dream  
she says one day the spirits will find me  
if they havent already  
i wonder if i will know how to hear them  

i make the same soup now  
i know now that  
the chickens are asian  
and the yam is african  
and the pepper is caribbean  
and the chocho is south american  
and the spices are indian  
and yet they form one dish  
that has to check _other_  
on the census  

people ask for my recipe  
as if they plan to open a restaurant  
people ask where i am from  
and hear _not here_ when i say _everywhere_  
people ask what i am  
i say _i am what i eat_  

because i learned long ago  
if you have to ask for a recipe  
then sweet child  
you dont know how to cook  
dont know how to listen to the food  
dont know how to hear the spirits  
sizzling  
and spitting  
and asking for ginger  

_so tek yuh spoon  
out a mi bowl_
