two bare feet walk off an alabama porch  
and into history

in your footsteps  
twelve hundred church shoes step into selma  
in your footsteps  
two million boots trod into the capitol  
in your footsteps  
countless feet lift the banner worldwide

rest now  
the work is not done  
but thanks to you  
neither are we
