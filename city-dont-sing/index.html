<p>see them walking, yeah<br>
don’t have nowhere to go<br>
see them talking, yeah<br>
how long<br>
they say we could never know</p>
<p>and my heart breaks for the people<br>
that need other people<br>
can’t get through life alone</p>
<p>and my heart breaks for the people<br>
when the city don’t sing no more</p>
<p>see them struggle, yeah<br>
can’t seem to pay the bills<br>
see them hustle, yeah<br>
survive every day<br>
on the strength of will</p>
<p>and my heart waits for the people<br>
that help other people<br>
get through this life alone</p>
<p>and my heart waits<br>
but the city don’t sing no more</p>
<p>lord the trouble just a pile up on we<br>
lord the struggle just a style up on we<br>
lord the trouble just a pile up on we<br>
lord the struggle just a style up on we</p>
<p>but still we a wait<br>
still we a wait<br>
still we a wait for salvation</p>
<p>and my heart waits for the people<br>
that help other people<br>
to get through life alone</p>
<p>and my heart breaks</p>
<p>but the city don’t sing no more</p>
