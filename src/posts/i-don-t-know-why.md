i don’t know why  
the chemicals that knit  
to form the fragrance of that  
first blushing mango  
take me home in an instant

or why i feel more at ease  
in the gentle rocking  
of a commuter train  
than i do in my home  

>

i don’t know why  
the line of your jaw  
and the smoke in your eyes  
make me knit letters into words

or why i would hang my heart  
like a lantern before my doorway  
to be bruised by the elements  
beating louder there than in my chest

>

i don’t know why  
i hate praise, but crave it  
fear love, but need it  
need touch, but reject it

or why i can shine  
incandescent  
yet still view myself  
a moth

>

i don’t know why  
i like what i like  
want who i want  
love who i love  

i just know i do  
and that is enough
