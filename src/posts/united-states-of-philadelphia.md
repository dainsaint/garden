poorest big city in america  
but we rich in spirit  
(and also capital)  

see there’s *change* in these  
couch cushions  
if you just take time to dig  

we’re just poor in the way  
that sidewalk acorns  
can’t grow leaves  

“poor” the way that movie girl  
is “ugly” before her makeover  
(but we stan a bitch in glasses)

you might fuck around and  
catch these hands  




you might slip and fall and  
find these hands catch you  

cause brotherly love means we will  
cuss you the fuck out  
if you fuckin up  
*cause we love you*  

and brotherly love means when  
these streets take one of ours  
we take to these streets  
*cause we love you*  

our mascots are neon chaos  
our main exports are “wish a nigga would”  
our national flower is a  
little black girl in beads  
who saw the police think  
they were above these hands
and raised her voice  
to sing our national anthem:

*“aight, bet”*


welcome to
**phila-  
fuck-around  
and-find-out-  
adelphia**

*(try the pretzels)*
