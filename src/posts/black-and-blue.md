i had one too many conversations with well-meaning white friends asking, "but why are they protesting in philly when this happened in minneapolis?"

so many hadn't even heard of the move bombing.

so we set out to create a comprehensive timeline of the history of police brutality against black philadelphians, from the founding of the department to today.

take some time. learn our history.
