see them walking, yeah  
don’t have nowhere to go  
see them talking, yeah  
how long  
they say we could never know

and my heart breaks for the people  
that need other people  
can’t get through life alone

and my heart breaks for the people  
when the city don’t sing no more

see them struggle, yeah  
can’t seem to pay the bills  
see them hustle, yeah  
survive every day  
on the strength of will

and my heart waits for the people  
that help other people  
get through this life alone

and my heart waits  
but the city don’t sing no more

lord the trouble just a pile up on we  
lord the struggle just a style up on we  
lord the trouble just a pile up on we  
lord the struggle just a style up on we

but still we a wait  
still we a wait  
still we a wait for salvation

and my heart waits for the people  
that help other people  
to get through life alone

and my heart breaks  

but the city don’t sing no more
