      <h2>soup</h2>
      
      <div class="post-project">part of <a href="/posts/these-truths/">these truths i have been afraid to speak</a></div>
      
      <p>chicken<br>
carrots and pumpkin<br>
yam and chocho and green banana<br>
a handful of allspice</p>
<p>and a scotch bonnet pepper<br>
hot enough to remind you<br>
you are strong enough<br>
to swallow the sun</p>
<p><em>do we have enough thyme</em> i wonder<br>
watching my mother skim the fat<br>
as i wait to drink a soup<br>
thick enough to plant a flag in</p>
<p>she is humming something long forgotten<br>
a song she was taught by a spirit in a dream<br>
she says one day the spirits will find me<br>
if they havent already<br>
i wonder if i will know how to hear them</p>
<p>i make the same soup now<br>
i know now that<br>
the chickens are asian<br>
and the yam is african<br>
and the pepper is caribbean<br>
and the chocho is south american<br>
and the spices are indian<br>
and yet they form one dish<br>
that has to check <em>other</em><br>
on the census</p>
<p>people ask for my recipe<br>
as if they plan to open a restaurant<br>
people ask where i am from<br>
and hear <em>not here</em> when i say <em>everywhere</em><br>
people ask what i am<br>
i say <em>i am what i eat</em></p>
<p>because i learned long ago<br>
if you have to ask for a recipe<br>
then sweet child<br>
you dont know how to cook<br>
dont know how to listen to the food<br>
dont know how to hear the spirits<br>
sizzling<br>
and spitting<br>
and asking for ginger</p>
<p><em>so tek yuh spoon<br>
out a mi bowl</em></p>
