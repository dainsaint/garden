*life is short, make every minute count.*  
*running late, running behind, running out of time.*  
*rise and grind, early bird, not a moment wasted.*  
memento moriâ€”*remember that you will die.*  

*don't waste my time time is money money is power*  
levels of extraction, refinement  
the industrialization of living  
mine an hour and refine it into labour sold for a number of dollars that buy you the power to... what?  

to feel free?  
in the time you have left?  
in the time you haven't sold?  

*no pain, no gain*  
as if a redwood *needed* trauma to tower.  

what else dies on the alter of time?  
*i'll sleep when I'm dead*  
as if the dead wouldn't give everything to sleep, to dream, to rest.   
to lay down in one form and wake up renewed:  
sleep is not death, it is metamorphosis, transformation  

sleep is the seed in winter soil  
the rising bread  
the baby in the belly  

*remember that you will die*  
did you remember that you will live?   

have you never lain with your lover  
and felt a minute stretch into forever?  
what would it feel like to  
make love to  
every  
moment?  

i am going to live forever   
i will make love to every moment  
i will ask *can I do this forever?*  
i will no longer strip-mine my time  
i will no longer colonize my time  

i will no longer tear up the  
richly watered ferns of my hours  
to steal bauxite from my red earth:  
*it is not sustainable*.  

if time were sand, then you would dread the last grain.  
but time is water, and you cannot drain the ocean.  

you are going to live forever  
you are going to live forever  
you are going to live forever  
so live
