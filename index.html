      <p><strong>1.</strong><br>
the word <em>spirit</em><br>
means<br>
<em>to breathe</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>2.</strong><br>
i once believed<br>
i could control the wind</p>
<p>when i was a boy<br>
i put out my hand<br>
the wind took it in hers<br>
and we ran wild together</p>
<p>when i ran she would<br>
  fill the kite of my back<br>
when i leapt she would<br>
  make gravity a suggestion<br>
when i cried she would<br>
  turn it to rain</p>
<p>at home<br>
the yelling was bad<br>
but the silence was worse<br>
so when i needed to escape<br>
i would climb my favourite tree<br>
where i could dance with her in the branches<br>
falling upwards into her deepest sky</p>
<p>the wind whispered in my ear<br>
  and told me where to go<br>
i whispered back to her<br>
  and told her where she had sent me</p>
<p>she was angry one day<br>
i saw how she darkened the sky<br>
but there was no room in our house<br>
for her emotions<br>
  i had to lock her out<br>
    i had no choice<br>
her tears poured and<br>
my hand reached out and<br>
the window was in reach and<br>
the hairs on my body stood on end and</p>
<p>her</p>
<p>lightning</p>
<p>struck</p>
<p>she punched me in the chest with thunder<br>
knocked the wind right out of me<br>
knocked me clean away from where<br>
her sorrow could hurt me</p>
<p>i understood<br>
it wasn't the first time someone had<br>
hit me<br>
  to protect me<br>
hit me<br>
  to teach me<br>
hit me<br>
  to control me</p>
<p>my voice had been so small<br>
i thought if i could hear the wind<br>
in the smallest whisper<br>
i shouldnt have to raise my voice<br>
to be heard<br>
but no one could hear her<br>
and so<br>
no one could hear me</p>
<p>so when she struck me<br>
i knew she controlled me<br>
and i knew<br>
i had no one<br>
left</p>
<p>i had to protect myself<br>
i knew she owned me<br>
had signed her name on my windpipe<br>
so i voided our contract<br>
twisted my throat shut<br>
and watched in the mirror<br>
  as my vision<br>
    went<br>
      black</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>3.</strong><br>
i still dont remember waking up<br>
she had blown the memory away<br>
she didnt want me to know<br>
it was she who had saved me<br>
even though the howl she left<br>
where a memory had been<br>
could only be hers</p>
<p>but now I knew<br>
  she had made a home in my lungs<br>
but now i knew<br>
  she needed me more than i needed her<br>
but now i knew<br>
  she loved me more than i loved myself<br>
but now i knew<br>
  that <em>i</em> controlled <em>her</em></p>
<p>i was powerful<br>
i would play my music<br>
  and she would dance for <em>me</em><br>
i would grab her hand<br>
  and pull her to where <em>i</em> wanted to go<br>
when she opened her sky in rage<br>
i would stand firm<br>
  and bathe<br>
  in her tears</p>
<p>i knew was undeserving<br>
  <em>why did i say <strong>control</strong></em>?<br>
i knew was uncivilized<br>
  <em>why did i say <strong>her</strong></em>?</p>
<p>i feared that a grown man who believed he could<br>
control the winds<br>
would be controlled himself<br>
locked in a padded cell<br>
so far away from the wind<br>
that a window would appear<br>
a tombstone</p>
<p>i had seen how this world treats<br>
those who can touch the spirits<br>
the only spirits we are allowed to touch<br>
are stuffed into a bottle<br>
and poured out<br>
wish by wish</p>
<p>i had to let her go<br>
  so <em>she</em> became <em>it</em><br>
became nothing more than a<br>
  high pressure system<br>
life became nothing more than a<br>
  high pressure system<br>
these checks<br>
and bills<br>
and debts<br>
and wills<br>
and friends<br>
and lovers<br>
became nothing more than a<br>
  high pressure system</p>
<p>sometimes we would pass each other<br>
in the street<br>
i would see her playing<br>
  in a corner<br>
making dna spirals out of dead leaves<br>
  making life out of death<br>
while i was<br>
  living life out of breath</p>
<p>drowning in a sea of oxygen<br>
dying of thirst for want of a glass</p>
<p>without her i had to learn how to breathe on my own<br>
when all i ever wanted<br>
was to fall upwards<br>
once more<br>
into her<br>
endless<br>
sky</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>4.</strong><br>
last week i saw her in the park<br>
she was playing with a child's balloon<br>
caressing a child's face<br>
tossing a child's hair<br>
and before i could stop myself<br>
i said<br>
hello</p>
<p>she looked up and<br>
she smiled and<br>
she ran over to me and<br>
she held me and<br>
she kissed me and<br>
she said<br>
<em>i've missed you</em><br>
and i finally realised</p>
<p>i never controlled the wind<br>
  the wind never controlled me<br>
it was never about control<br>
  in the first place</p>

people ask what i am<br>
i say <em>i am what i eat</em></p>

if you have to ask for a recipe<br>
then sweet child<br>
you dont know how to cook<br>
dont know how to listen to the food<br>

      <p><strong>midnight</strong> was three, of course<br>
he had to be<br>
a quick black triangle<br>
darting out the door<br>
almost as fast as my mother did<br>
earlier that year</p>
<p>i didnt blame him<br>
if my legs could carry me as swiftly<br>
i would have run just as readily<br>
just as unprepared<br>
into a world so quick<br>
to extinguish excitement</p>
<p>the police would come<br>
accusing us as we buried him<br>
flashlights and guns<br>
so eager to extinguish my grief<br>
that i forgot i had any<br>
left only with a box-shaped hole</p>
<p><strong>daybreak</strong> was twenty, of course<br>
midnight's sister<br>
crushed over and over by time<br>
and mistreatment<br>
and illness<br>
it was miracle she survived at all</p>
<p>when she re-entered my care<br>
and her womb ruptured<br>
she was as surprised as i was<br>
that she remained alive<br>
that having attention paid to her<br>
was all she needed to stay</p>
<p>and so through sickness<br>
and blindness<br>
and fear<br>
she held tight to life<br>
knowing herself lucky<br>
to have anything to hold at all</p>
<p><strong>dusk</strong> was fifteen, of course<br>
clever, and friendly<br>
and too sweet, by far<br>
such that he could not abide<br>
his own sweetness<br>
so we managed it for him</p>
<p>not content to be extinguished<br>
or to be ignored<br>
he took up space in a way i envied<br>
voiced desire in a way i lacked<br>
gave affection in a way i admired<br>
made the loudness of his existence known</p>
<p>he made each of his nine lives felt<br>
each of his eight miracles<br>
and went without question<br>
with no box-shaped hole<br>
or tightly-held fear to hold him<br>
slipping away as peacefully as his namesake</p>
<p>and still,<br>
we have <strong>dawn</strong></p>

that i was too blind to see<br>
the sickness in my chest that says i am too old too weak<br>
the sickness in my mind that says to wake up to defeat<br>
but who wants to stay woke when i can dream</p>
<p>put me on repeat<br>
put me on instagram<br>
put me inside another box<br>
to make all your demands<br>
the voices in my head are back<br>
voices in my head are black<br>
saul and james and all the names<br>
that spilled their ink up on this track</p>
<p>now i'm flowing mentally<br>
think environmentally<br>
penmanship is dying my handwriting aint whats meant to be<br>
but chicken scratch is braver than the ascii that i labor with<br>
and labor is the saviour that has left its marx on all our kids<br>
kids in gig economies<br>
kids that love astrology<br>
kids make no apologies<br>
these kids that love technology<br>
now im not from the streets i took a lyft to where i got to be<br>
i'm still another box to tick five stars up my the profit sheet<br>
i was once a—<strong>i was once a</strong>—prophet with a scholarship<br>
trade it all for twenty days on mescaline if dr king acknowledge it</p>
<p>last night was mlk<br>
last night i had a dream<br>
this morning woke up got a pen<br>
to find out what it mean<br>
&quot;open up your mind too far no telling what will take its place&quot;<br>
&quot;do whatever you want son, just be a credit to your race&quot;<br>
man i cried myself to sleep<br>
and i woke up with a scream<br>
cause wants to stay woke when i can dream</p>

      <div class="post-content-text">
      <p>I never knew my father.</p>
<p>I’d heard stories, of course. None of them good, but then single mothers rarely have good things to say about the men that abandon them. He was charming, sure. She'd say he had some hustle, some of that old-school swagger on him. They had a relationship when they were younger, that kind of fling that both starts and ends in fire. And at the end of it, yeah, it was me and her and not him. So I never knew him.</p>
<p>Two days before my thirteenth birthday I woke up to a notification that he was gone. <em>Samuel Dixon, 45, struck by a drunk driver and pronounced dead on arrival. His memorial will be held at blah blah blah who cares</em>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we didn't attend.  Mom was shook though—this was a dude she'd come up with, and even though they ain't have it like that no more, I could tell losing even the <em>possibility</em> was messing with her more than she let on. But he was gone, and that was that.</p>
<p>A couple months later, I got another notification:</p>
<p>“Someone you know has joined Forest.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Forest had been around for eight years now, but it was already everywhere. A joint venture of some San Fran chatbot company and an Italian design firm, it took off faster than anyone had expected. &quot;For centuries,&quot; the ads would say, &quot;we've hoped to communicate with our ancestors. Why not make it a reality?&quot;</p>
<p>It worked like this: When you die, they seal your body up in a pod with some dirt, some fertilizer, and a young tree. They plant you in one of their &quot;memory forests&quot;, and as you decompose your body becomes fertilizer for the tree. You <em>become</em> the tree. So now your grandkids can come, like, sit under your branches, right?</p>
<p>But, 'cause its a tech company, they gotta go a step further with it: you also will a copy of <em>your entire digital footprint</em> to Forest. That's every email, every text, every tweet and snap, every selfie and group vid and dick pic you've ever sent goes in an algorithm—and a AI chatbot that looks and sounds <em>just like you</em> comes out the other end. So now, when your grandkids come visit your tree, they can have real-ass conversations with some off-brand hologram of <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, you become digital ghost hanging around a haunted forest. It'd be impressive if it wasn't so damn <em>creepy</em>.</p>
<p>So naturally, when I get that notification, I know damn well there's only one person it could be. Sammy Dixon, good old &quot;dad&quot;. A man whose face I can't even picture without a frame around it, and <em>now</em> he wants to acknowledge I'm his blood? Fuck that noise. You didn't want me in your life, why I should I be in your death?</p>
<p>I swiped that shit right in the trash.</p>
<hr>
<p>It felt good. Almost like, after all these years, <em>I</em> got to be the one ignoring <em>him</em>. <em>Take your weak-ass invite and shove it</em>, I'd say to myself. <em>Th’fuck, I'm supposed to play catch with a tree?</em></p>
<p>But after a while, something started changing. This girl Lindsey at my school, she lost her auntie or something to cancer—a girl cancer, one of the bad ones. And <em>her</em> auntie joined Forest. And <em>she</em> was comin' in every other weekend talkin about how she had this <em>incredible</em> conversation with her, how she got to hear <em>stories</em>, and <em>share</em> shit and I dunno. Something just kinda started shifting. I started feeling like I was missing out? Like I could learn something about myself. At the very least, it was something to do.</p>
<p>So a couple months after my fourteenth birthday—almost a year after I got that first notification—I said <em>fuck it</em>. I got on the bus, took the long-ass two-transfer route I had to take to get all the way out to Evansburg, and hoofed it down to the Forest office. It was built at the tip of a park they'd gotten on lease from the state—you could still see the trailer they started out of breaking down in the parking lot. I filled out a bunch of paperwork, gave them a blood sample to prove kinship, and that was that.</p>
<p>The girl behind the counter handed a little medallion, a smooth black pebble with a bright blue screen on one side. &quot;Here you go,&quot; she said. The screen flashed three times, then popped up an arrow. &quot;This is your locator; it will help you find your father's plot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, y'all don't have an app for that?&quot;</p>
<p>She chuckled. &quot;We did think about it, but we were worried about privacy concerns. The pebble is much more secure; it only works on the grounds. Enjoy your time in the Forest!&quot;</p>
<p><em>Sure, okay</em>, I thought. <em>I'm just gonna wander through this ghost forest</em>. I kept lookin at those trees, and every time all I could think was <em>Well, that tree used to be a dude</em>, or <em>That’s someone's moms</em>, or <em>Oh look, there go Uncle Johnny.</em></p>
<p>I wandered through that <em>haunted-ass forest</em> feelin all kinds of stupid. <em>Look at your dumb ass</em>, I thought. <em>You know you the black guy that dies first in the movie.</em></p>
<p>I kept following the pebble, down the long paths lined with trees of all ages. Some looked like they had just been planted; some looked like they'd been there for a hundred years already. Each one had a silver podium in front; <em>I guess that's where they keep the ghosts</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>Of course the second I thought the word <em>ghosts</em> I was <em>not</em> okay; all I wanted to do was bounce. And to be honest, I chickened out. I'd just turned around to leave when, two rows over, I saw some Japanese-looking family. They had their whole damn setup there, with the incense and photos and I dunno. It made me feel... stupid? Like, they had some three-and-four-year old kids smiling so happy under granddad's tree, and there I was sweatin' like I got off the bus five stops too late? Stupid. Stupid, stupid.</p>
<p>So I pressed on until I found it. Sam Dixon's tree. Just this real young-lookin thing, barely five feet tall—it looked so damn <em>fragile</em>. Like I coulda ripped the whole tree out the ground with my bare hands. So my heart rate came down a bit. I started to see it for what it was: just a kiosk, and a tree. I walked up to the little metal podium, touched my thumb to the reader. There was a whirr, a little prick, and some LEDs flashing as it came to life.</p>
<p>And there I was, staring at the faint blue ‘gram of Sam Dixon, lookin like some early-Aught’s CGI before they figured out how to make people's skin look right.  His head just floating, and staring, and not emoting. Not saying anything. I didn't know if the shit was still booting up, or he was waiting for me to say something.</p>
<p>So I just looked at him. I looked at that line up, that fade, the single diamond earring. His thick black eyebrows sat lazily over drooping eyes; his broad nose lead to a tightly trimmed beard. This was my father—an old photograph made real.</p>
<p>Then whatever shit was happening in the computers finished, and this wax sculpture of a head sprang to life. His skin relaxed, and his face settled into an easy grin as his eyes locked with mine. He was <em>looking</em> at me. Right in the eye socket. I was halfway to tryin to figure out how they pulled that shit off when he finally spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn, kid. You look just like your momma.&quot;</p>
<p>Man... I don't even remember how I got back to the bus stop; I just know my heart and lungs and knees hurt, so I musta been running. Usain Bolt up in this motherfucker, miss me with that haunted shit.</p>
<p>I didn't go back for two months.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;Hey kid. Welcome back&quot;</p>
<p>The shit was <em>freaky</em>, man. The 'gram had this faint blue glow that just made the shit <em>look</em> like a ghost, but the speakers were so clean and clear he sounded like he was standing right in front of me. It was the world's most disturbing FaceTime.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh. What's up,&quot; I said. &quot;Sam,&quot; I added, feeling oddly rude in the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm dead, Michael. Nothin' new going on over here.&quot;</p>
<p>Ouch. &quot;So you supposed to be my dad, huh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm trying to be.&quot; Some weird synthesizer sound came out of the speakers; I had to look at his face to realize he was laughing. It came out like an auto-tuned dog bark; not right at <em>all</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got his memories, at least of what was recorded of them. And the more we interact, the better I'll be able to replicate his speech patterns and mannerisms.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, like Pinocchio? You'll become a real boy?&quot;</p>
<p>He screwed his face up like he smelled something bad. &quot;Y'know something? I think Pinocchio was the first movie I showed you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, it's right here in the chat log. Yeah. You were born February 12th, 2011... then I sent a text here to Andrea...&quot;</p>
<p>He paused; he must've seen my face. &quot;To your momma... on August 5th that same year. Don't seem likely you saw anything between that one,&quot; he said. &quot;You probably don't remember it.&quot;</p>
<p>I was shook. &quot;Yeah you're right. I don't remember that.&quot;</p>
<p>It was so quiet; no wind, no leaves. And just like that, I was done.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. Yeah. I can't deal with this right now. I'm out.&quot; I turned to leave.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, Mike. I'll see you next time.&quot;</p>
<p>I threw out a half-hearted &quot;Yeah, whatever&quot; and bounced without looking back.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, I kept going back. I just wanted to figure him out, y'know? Mom said I got that from her; she said she'd spent a bunch of her life trying to figure him out too, and not to expect too much. One time I asked her if she was mad I kept going, but she just smiled and said, &quot;I always wanted you two to have a relationship.&quot; She headed off to finish getting ready for her night shift, saying something that sounded suspiciously like &quot;At least this version will stay in one place.&quot;</p>
<p>So I kept going. We'd talk about ball—he stanned LeBron (typical), ain't even <em>heard</em> of Rivera yet. He upgraded my playlist, introduced me to Saul Williams and SZA. I asked him to tell me what 9/11 was like, but he said his chat log didn't go back that far. I asked him about the Trump years and he just let off that same ring-tone-ass laugh and said, &quot;How long you got?&quot;</p>
<p>Every now and then the illusion would break; he'd stutter saying something, or repeat himself, and I'd remember it was just a program, just a simulation, not the real thing.</p>
<p>But only now and then.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;I don't even know, like, what I need from you, man. Like, why I came at <em>all</em>. Like, I already know why you left—you didn't want the responsibility. I get it.&quot; I couldn't bring myself to look the 'gram in the eye. &quot;It's shitty, but I get it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Michael—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like if it was me,&quot; I spat, &quot;I'd probably pull the same whack shit. I ain't even wanna like do a group project, and that shit was only for a week.&quot; I kicked at an innocent rock. &quot;Who wants to sign up for a eighteen year group project?&quot;</p>
<p>Sam flickered.</p>
<p>&quot;Kid, is that what you think you are? A group project? Listen to yourself. You think you're lazy, and you get that from me? But kid, we ain't lazy.&quot;</p>
<p>He breathed to prepare for his excuse. &quot;I wasn't there because... &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Cause you didn't fuckin' want me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Cause I didn't think I was good enough, Michael!&quot; The speaker crackled, a sharp burst of noise echoing through the Forest. &quot;I was so screwed up in the head, man, I couldn't hold down a steady gig, and like...&quot;</p>
<p>I didn't know what to say. His face was contorted, like he ate something he was having a hard time swallowing. &quot;Me and my boy Randall used to talk about <em>my</em> dad, and how like...all his bullshit. The drinking...&quot;</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, for the first time I'd ever seen. As little as mom told me about Sam, she told me even less about my grandfather. For the first time in my life, I felt like I understood why.</p>
<p>&quot;I was afraid I'd screw you up the way he screwed me up. Thought you were better without me. The both of you.&quot;</p>
<p>For a while, I just stood saying nothing. What could you say? I turned the pebble over in my palm, over and over; I'd long since memorized the way to him, but there was something about it that was comforting. Like I couldn't get lost.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, watch your mouth, kid. Your momma would kill me if she knew I let you cuss like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...What?&quot;</p>
<p>Then, that weird-ass auto-tuned laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. Oh you got jokes now.&quot;</p>
<p>Then it's him, and me, laughing together in the trees.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;I dunno man. I just... I keep trying shit, to see what sticks?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mmhmm.&quot;</p>
<p>We've been chatting for a while now. I was supposed to start looking at colleges and like... what? I was supposed to just figure out what I'm studying to become? To know what I wanted to be when I grew up? I couldn't even settle on a damn handle.</p>
<p>&quot;So yeah. I don't know what I wanna study. And I guess I just wanna make sure have a social life while I'm studying, right?&quot;</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrow at me. &quot;Hey, don't judge me! School's important an' all but like... it's supposed to be a good time too, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't even get to college, kid, I ain't got shit to say about that,&quot; he laughs.</p>
<p>&quot;Mike, I woulda been proud of you. Just so you know.&quot;</p>
<p>You know how sometimes it's raining, but the sun's still out?</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, Dad.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>That day. I was so excited to go see him. I didn't even have somethin to talk about, just wanted to see him, hear his voice. My face was changing, filling out, gaining edges—his jaw, his cheekbones. And I had some shit goin on in my life I feel like he'd would've found funny. And I found myself wanting to hear that weird, auto-tuned laugh of his.</p>
<p>When I turned the corner to his plot, I knew something was up.
Half the tree was black, leaves missing; the air smelled like an old grill. The podium was too clean, too new. It had clearly been replaced; there was still a thin plastic film over the scanner.</p>
<p>Attached was a note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Due to an electrical incident, this unit has been replaced and reset to factory settings.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, in tiny letters underneath:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Factory settings?</em> I wondered. My stomach dropped as I placed my thumb on the scanner, felt the quick prick of the needle.</p>
<p>The 'gram starts up, and I see his face again. Samuel Dixon, dead at 45. It glitches out, resets, jerks his face back in time. My father. My <em>dad</em>. I feel woozy, try to steady myself with the podium.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn, kid,&quot; he said. My eyes were already filled with tears; I knew exactly what he was gonna say, and exactly what it meant.</p>
<p>&quot;You look just like your momma.&quot;</p>

      <p>It started out small.</p>
<p>I was at a restaurant, waiting for my chicken or whatever to show up. The place was one of those modern joints built into a turn-of-the-century building: wood and steel, high-efficiency lightbulbs and exposed brick. Seated near the window, I was absent-mindedly rubbing my fingers along the mortar holding the wall together. I felt the smallest of snaps, like breaking the arm off a porcelain ballerina, and suddenly I was rolling a piece of mortar between my fingers.</p>
<p>It was small, y'know? It wasn’t until I got home to my cramped little efficiency that I realized I was still carrying this piece of mortar. I put it down on my little Ikea desk and stared at it for a while before I went to bed.</p>
<p>For the rest of the week, I’d get up, go to work, come home and watch TV or whatever. But every time I’d go to bed, I’d look at this little piece of mortar, and I wouldn’t know why.</p>
<p>When I went back to the restaurant like three weeks later or so, I by chance got seated at the same table. And waiting for my pasta or whatever, my hands found the spot where the mortar used to be. And there was fresh mortar.</p>
<p>And then it hit me: <em>I stole a part of the building</em>.</p>
<p>The worst ideas are the ones where you can’t tell if it’s the worst idea or the best idea. But that night, the mortar on my desk was joined by a loose piece of wood from the windowsill.</p>
<p>I was eating at that restaurant three times a week now. I’d just take a little of whatever was falling apart. Bits of brick, mortar, wood, linoleum. A fixture was loose in the bathroom. A bolt was loose on a bar stool.</p>
<p>Pretty soon I had a duffel bag full of detritus in my apartment. I wasn’t sleeping. Eight hours of staring at this bag, then right back out the door to catch breakfast and a hunk of loose marble from the bartop. And every time I thought I took something too big – a doorknob, or a light fixture – it would just get replaced. I was a bacterium, really, eating bits and pieces, and this building was <em>healing</em> itself.</p>
<p>The leg of a chair broke off. That Thursday morning it was in the trash. That Thursday night it was in my overflowing apartment. My apartment looked like a construction site, but I knew where everything belonged. I had long since memorized the restaurant. But I finally realized why the junk wouldn’t let me sleep; it was homeless.</p>
<p>Soon I was too. Turns out, eating out all the time gets really expensive. I was wheeling crates of building around, looking for a home. What I found was an abandoned lot with a 1000ft spool of stiff steel wire.</p>
<p>I built a wireframe. I knew where everything belonged. Everything. Light fixtures hanging on wire, brick and wood tied to the frame. Chairs, and bits of tables. Empty liquor bottles stocking an empty bar.</p>
<p>It took two days to flesh out the wireframe. And now I can see it – the full, original restaurant, here, 70 blocks away from where it was born. Waiting for me to finish. My Sistene Chapel. My Ark.</p>
<p>If you replace every part of a boat, is it the same boat?</p>
<p>If I steal this building, won’t mine be the real one?</p>

      <p>&quot;I'm not sure I understand.&quot;</p>
<p>Perry smiles and takes a deep breath. &quot;I know I have forever to explain this to you, Quentin,&quot; he says, &quot;but I'd rather not take it.&quot;</p>
<p>Quentin chuckles as the pair look out on the fractured landscape, great glaciers of obsidian glass undulating as would the pistons of a great engine. &quot;I don't mean to be daft, just having a bit of a hard time with the concept. Where is this place?&quot;
Perry shakes his head. &quot;You're still using the wrong adverbs, chap. You are not in a place, you are at a time. Or an untime, rather.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well how did I get here? Or, now, I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it would be obvious. You've time travelled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you said that eariler, and I maintain that the thought is just as ridiculous as when I first heard it. I am not a scientist --&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well that much is apparent,&quot; interrupts Percy.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes well, glibness aside, that merely proves my point. If I am having such a hard time fathoming what has taken place, how can I possibly have the wherewithal to travel through time itself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's a rather good point,&quot; says Percy, thoughtfully tapping his pipe against the heel of his shoe. &quot;perhaps you hit your head on the way in and have forgotten you were a brilliant astrophysicist. Or instead got incredibly drunk and fell into a passing wormhole.&quot;</p>
<p>Quentin pretends to contemplate this for a moment.
&quot;Untime?&quot; he continues.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Well you know time travel is impossible, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you said--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And this is when impossible things go.&quot;</p>
<p>Quentin lets the grammar of that sentence wash over him as a flock of sparrows bursts fully formed from a rotted apple in the distance.</p>

      <p>A star explodes in my brain and I'm awake. In my nostrils, the smell of steel; in my mouth, the taste of copper. White-hot light sears my eyes; my ears scream as blood rushes through. My joints snap like splintered wood, fingers crackling towards the sky, as wet coughs escape my dry throat.</p>
<p>I'm alive. Fucking Christ, where am I? Cold metal on my back, dry plastic on my legs... I'm naked. Fucking autopsy table? I touch my chest, but there's no incision, no stitches. They didn't cut me open.</p>
<p>What happened? I was at a bar... Sadie's... Meeting someone? The fucking deal... I remember dim lights, damp tables, shitty beer and that cocksuck Guillerme with his yellow eyes and shit-eating grin.</p>
<p>That motherfucker. He poisoned me. Deadly nightshade. &quot;You cross us, you wish you dead, eh?&quot; Now I know what he meant. Nightshade induces paralysis, slows the metabolism, stops the heart. A mask like unto death.</p>
<p>Right. Step one: pants. Step two: beer. Step three: find Guillerme and stab him in the dick.</p>
<p>I try to move and fail, falling off the table and landing in a bloody, naked heap. Every part of me screams out in pain, and under my curses and gasps I hear a sound like wet leather ripping. My insides shift and I grab my side. It's wet with blood, and my head lurches with nausea like the fucking SS goosestepped on my crotch.</p>
<p>For some reason, I think of the day I got my driver's license.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh, fuck!&quot;</p>
<p>Delirious from the pain, I wrap the plastic sheet around me like a towel. I'm leaving bloody handprints everywhere, my gut drooling like a St. Bernard. I find a clipboard attached to the bottom of the table - my last name, blood type, a bunch of fucking acronyms, and what I'm lookin for: OR5. I grab something steel and sharp looking from a caddy and bleed my way into the hallway.</p>
<p>There's arrows and maps on the wall, but I can't make sense of it. I'm losing blood fast, and with it, my balance and my patience. I stumble into what I guess is a break room to the sound of a girl screaming and a mug of coffee breaking. I point whatever it is I'm carrying and bark, &quot;OR Five! Now!&quot;</p>
<p>And she's nodding and walking, and I'm grabbing onto her and bleeding.</p>
<p>Forever happens.</p>
<p>And the operating theatre is treated to a crazed, naked, blood-soaked lunatic shoulder-checking his way into surgery. As I point at the lump of meat in the surgeon's hands, I realize it's time to update my plan.</p>
<p>&quot;Give that back!&quot;</p>
<p>Step zero: Retrieve my liver. I'll need it for step two.</p>

      <p>My mother says, &quot;Close your eyes.&quot; She waits a moment, then adds, &quot;Push it to the top of your mouth, and exhale slowly.&quot;</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>She says, &quot;Let your mind relax.&quot;</p>
<p>I try. I drown out the clinking of glasses, taking of orders. The couple two tables to the right just got engaged. The guy at the bar buying a round just got promoted.</p>
<p>Drown them out.</p>
<p>Another moment, and she says, &quot;Now tell me.&quot;</p>
<p>I concentrate, moving the lump of food to the left, to the right. Images zoom past, a memory zoetrope, herbal rolodex, and...</p>
<p>I tell her, &quot;Salt, obviously. Black pepper. Cumin, oregano, and vinegar.&quot; She says, &quot;And?&quot;</p>
<p>I inhale slightly, a few more images popping up. &quot;Onions and garlic? No, it's milder than that. Shallots. And scallion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Keep going.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um... Something lemony. Not sweet enough to be the juice, not flowery enough to be lemongrass. Lemon oil?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Close.&quot;</p>
<p>I move the food a millimeter backwards. My tastebuds pick up on the bitterness. &quot;Lemon peel.&quot;</p>
<p>I hear her thinking; the sound of an inked nib slicing checkmarks into a sheet of parchment. She asks me, &quot;How?&quot;</p>
<p>I've exhausted this forkful, so I swallow it and procure another. &quot;Concentrate,&quot; she says, in that nagging authoritative tone. I move small pockets of air back and forth through my nostrils, trying to discern everything that happened to every ingredient, every thought of the chef. The way my mother talks about it, you'd think you could tell a person's life—past, present, and future—through taste alone. Something mystical.</p>
<p>It finally hits. The slight scent of smoke. &quot;Faintest hint of caramelization. He cut the peel, flexed it to release the oil, and fried it with the shallots and scallions.&quot; A moment later, I add, &quot;In grapeseed oil.&quot;</p>
<p>She says nothing for a while, so I open my eyes, and ask, &quot;Can I enjoy my meal now?&quot;</p>
<p>She smiles and says, &quot;Not yet. But you're getting closer. Now dig in.&quot;</p>

      <p>I was fifteen when I died.</p>
<p>She came to me, radiant gossamer beauty, and gave me a choice. And because I was afraid, I said no. She didn't say anything, but Her disappointment killed me as I watched Her smile, and fade to nothingness, leaving me alone in the wood-brown living room of my parent's house.</p>
<p>I didn't know it then, but that's when I died.</p>
<p>I soon saw the others on the news. Champions, they said. Righting wrongs, striving for good. I shit you not—one of them actually pulled a cat out of a gaddamn tree. And as the years went on, sixteen, seventeen, I admit, I became jealous. Jealous of the attention they received, the spotlight I walked away from.</p>
<p>I was nineteen. I didn't know it then, but that's when I met my wife, Virginia, blond pigtails and green plaid skirt bouncing to the pop stand. Of course, it'd be two years till we sat next to each other in the lecture hall at university that she'd even know I existed. It'd be a year after that, when I comforted her after that asshole Eric dumped her for Kathy Ferguson, that she'd start to have feelings for me. It'd be another year till after graduation, when we'd sit on the hood of my beat up '75 Camaro, when we'd consider a life together. All the while, feeling hollow and unfulfilled, useless. I learned how to fake a good enough smile, and—God bless her—Ginny never questioned why I'd leave the room when the Champions were on the 6 o'clock news.</p>
<p>In another year, when I was twenty-four, the Forty Year War would break out. The Champions were on the news again, but broken, bloodied. Beaten again and again as Malevolence spread. Month after month, Ginny's belly grew under an advancing cloud of fear. Year after year, the Champions— those that remained—fought to keep our family safe. Year after year, fewer Champions, more Malevolence, and Ginny still never knew how close she had come to seeing me in the papers. Instead of fear, I felt regret. The Champions were losing, and y'know, you wonder, &quot;Would I have made a difference? Just one more?&quot; Regret turned to shame pretty quickly. Ginny would worry and ask, and blame herself, and I couldn't even lift a finger to comfort her.</p>
<p>When the last Champion was shown this morning, limp body broken over the rubble in what was left of Rotterdam, searching for more blood to leak, and the world's nations grew silent to hear the words of Malevolence, I was in the living room. That same damn living room I'd inherited from my parents, chambering a .38 round. I knew then, finally, at sixty-four, that I had indeed died when I was fifteen. I decided it was time to make that feeling a reality. I was so far gone I couldn't even hear Ginny screaming for me to stop as I jammed the barrel deeper under my chin, finger slipping on the trigger as the tears fell hard and fast. I couldn't hear her as I pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>I couldn't hear the click. Or the bang, or the sound of bone fragments raining down on the polyester sofa. I couldn't feel the bullet pierce my skull, or the recoil yank my arms down.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I couldn't feel the gun in my hand any more. I could only feel a warmth that I had only known some fifty-nine years before. She came back to me, standing exactly where She first stood. Poor Ginny must've been kickin' her jaw it'dve dropped so far. Standing there, She gave me the same choice now. This arthritic, defeated, sixty-four year old shell, She gives the same choice. Become an instrument of good, of light. Become <em>strong</em>. Be what this world needs.</p>
<p>What the fuck do you think I said?</p>
