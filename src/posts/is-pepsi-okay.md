_So to drink, we have Prison  
Sugary-sweet and full-flavoured  
It's bad for the health but it sure tastes great_

_Or if you prefer, we have Diet Vengeance  
It's not as satisfying as Prison  
But you won't mind while the taste is on your lips_

but i only asked for justice  
straight from the tap  
a taste of remorse  
an ounce of regret  
a pint of recognition  
a glass of restitution  
i do not want  
to drink your substitutes  
only to find  
that i am still thirsty

_Well I'm sorry, but  
If you aren't going order anything  
I'm going to have to ask you to leave_
