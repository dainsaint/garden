have you ever fought a tide  
or a wave  
or swam upstream  
or have you let the waters  
carry you to shore  
>
have you walked aimlessly  
through the city  
to end up exactly  
where you needed to be  
>
have you been touched without agenda  
kissed without expectation  
let your skin melt past  
the thought of mere pleasure  
and felt the universe explode  
within your bones  
>
have you walked away  
from that which hurts  
with no road ahead  
and no need of one  
>
have you let yourself  
simply be  

have you?  
have i?
