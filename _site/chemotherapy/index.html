<p>the cancer was there<br>
at the beginning<br>
and for the longest time<br>
we've been addicted to smoking</p>
<p>the chemotherapy <em><strong>burns</strong></em></p>
<p>sets fire to the arteries<br>
burning cancerous and helathy alike<br>
our hair falls out<br>
but we beat the cancer back</p>
<p>at least for a while</p>
<p>the cancer remained<br>
always waiting<br>
for a chance<br>
to <em>s p r e a d</em></p>
<p>killing those parts of you<br>
you never deemed important enough<br>
to see</p>
<p>we think ourselves cured</p>
<p>we keep smoking</p>
<p><em>we can't breathe</em></p>
<p>it solves <strong>nothing</strong><br>
<em>but we need to smoke</em><br>
it solves <strong>nothing</strong><br>
<em>it's all we can do to quell the anxiety</em><br>
it solves <strong>nothing</strong><br>
<em>it helps us feel in control</em><br>
it solves <strong>nothing</strong><br>
<em>expensive, nasty, brutish habit</em><br>
<em>and we spend more on it every year</em></p>
<p>we catch a flu<br>
and have to decide between fighting<br>
the flu that may kill us soon<br>
and<br>
the cancer that kills us every day</p>
<p>the tumours return<br>
spreading, malignant<br>
<em>this far</em>, we say, <em>and no farther</em></p>
<p>so now it falls to us<br>
we administer the chemotherapy<br>
it <em><strong>burns</strong></em> once more
we <em>will</em> knock this cancer into remission<br>
again</p>
<p>but if you're tired<br>
of having your life<br>
interrupted
by our aggressive course of treatment...</p>
<p>...quit smoking.</p>
