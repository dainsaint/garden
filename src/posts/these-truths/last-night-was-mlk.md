last night was mlk  
last night i had a dream  
this morning had a nightmare  
that my dream was yet unseen  
i hear voices in my heart  
i dont know what they mean  
but i understand the truth  
yes i understand the scene  

yes i understand the amazon  
understand that Amazon  
understand the ancient days of planning in advance are gone  
understand the bassline in the back of my dreamlands are gone  
take my hand and show me that the days of my romance are gone  

woke up with a bassline that i sold to comcast for a dime  
heard them play it back to me online for dollar ninety-nine  
sickness in my chest is back  
sickness in my heart is black  
black is not the sickness its the witness to the sickness  
its the nurse the judge the jury  
but this jury's hung with fury  

last night was mlk  
last night i had a dream  
this morning had a nightmare  
that i was too blind to see  
the sickness in my chest that says i am too old too weak  
the sickness in my mind that says to wake up to defeat  
but who wants to stay woke when i can dream  

put me on repeat  
put me on instagram  
put me inside another box  
to make all your demands  
the voices in my head are back  
voices in my head are black  
saul and james and all the names  
that spilled their ink up on this track  

now i'm flowing mentally  
think environmentally  
penmanship is dying my handwriting aint whats meant to be  
but chicken scratch is braver than the ascii that i labor with  
and labor is the saviour that has left its marx on all our kids  
kids in gig economies  
kids that love astrology  
kids make no apologies  
these kids that love technology  
now im not from the streets i took a lyft to where i got to be  
i'm still another box to tick five stars up my the profit sheet  
i was once a—**i was once a**—prophet with a scholarship  
trade it all for twenty days on mescaline if dr king acknowledge it  

last night was mlk  
last night i had a dream  
this morning woke up got a pen  
to find out what it mean  
"open up your mind too far no telling what will take its place"  
"do whatever you want son, just be a credit to your race"  
man i cried myself to sleep  
and i woke up with a scream  
cause wants to stay woke when i can dream
