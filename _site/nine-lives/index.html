      <p><strong>midnight</strong> was three, of course<br>
he had to be<br>
a quick black triangle<br>
darting out the door<br>
almost as fast as my mother did<br>
earlier that year</p>
<p>i didnt blame him<br>
if my legs could carry me as swiftly<br>
i would have run just as readily<br>
just as unprepared<br>
into a world so quick<br>
to extinguish excitement</p>
<p>the police would come<br>
accusing us as we buried him<br>
flashlights and guns<br>
so eager to extinguish my grief<br>
that i forgot i had any<br>
left only with a box-shaped hole</p>
<p><strong>daybreak</strong> was twenty, of course<br>
midnight's sister<br>
crushed over and over by time<br>
and mistreatment<br>
and illness<br>
it was miracle she survived at all</p>
<p>when she re-entered my care<br>
and her womb ruptured<br>
she was as surprised as i was<br>
that she remained alive<br>
that having attention paid to her<br>
was all she needed to stay</p>
<p>and so through sickness<br>
and blindness<br>
and fear<br>
she held tight to life<br>
knowing herself lucky<br>
to have anything to hold at all</p>
<p><strong>dusk</strong> was fifteen, of course<br>
clever, and friendly<br>
and too sweet, by far<br>
such that he could not abide<br>
his own sweetness<br>
so we managed it for him</p>
<p>not content to be extinguished<br>
or to be ignored<br>
he took up space in a way i envied<br>
voiced desire in a way i lacked<br>
gave affection in a way i admired<br>
made the loudness of his existence known</p>
<p>he made each of his nine lives felt<br>
each of his eight miracles<br>
and went without question<br>
with no box-shaped hole<br>
or tightly-held fear to hold him<br>
slipping away as peacefully as his namesake</p>
<p>and still,<br>
we have <strong>dawn</strong></p>
