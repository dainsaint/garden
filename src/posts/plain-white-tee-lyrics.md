bust in the room like im in a saloon   
look fresh to death wearing fruit of the loom   
people break necks just to look and see   
cuz they can't take their eyes off my plain white tee   

some of y'all rollin in a suit and tie   
spend a lotta money, lookin extra fly   
yeah, you look good, but not like me   
cuz you cant hold a candle to a plain white tee   

i know you rollin on some louis v   
ice on the wrist so everybody see   
might not be my place to disagree   
but when the black light hit me i don’t stop glowing   
so go on with your fancy, and i'll keep showing off my   

plain white tee   
plain white tee   
don’t i look good in a plain white tee   
some of y’all cats prefer versace   
but i’ma be fine in my plain white tee   

plain white tee   
plain white tee   
bout to roll up on a pyt   
ain't gotta be rich with a body like me   
cuz i’ma be fine in a plain white tee   

billboards cover every inch of sky   
bored-to-death models for the camera eye   
how you look sad when the threads so clean?   
you spent all your money, guess the smile ain’t free   

i could play ball in a three-piece suit   
head to the opera in some timberland boots   
shit, i look cute and thats the truth   
so props to my momma for the fountain of youth  

so go head and do your thing   
i'ma look dope in a set of hanes   
if you like it, girl, we could get away   
but if you just can't wait to get under cover   
go ahead, rip it off, i can just buy another   

plain white tee   
plain white tee   
damn i look good in a plain white tee   
some of y’all cats prefer givenchy   
but i’ma be fine in my plain white tee   

plain white tee   
plain white tee   
ain’t nobody else looking fly like me   
can’t never go wrong with a spirit so free   
and it don’t get freer than a plain white tee   

now i’m not trying to say   
that you shouldn’t dress nice and look your best   
but you can’t spend cents on confidence, oh no   
so come on out and play   
be comfortable in your own skin   
and we can rule the world while lounging in a   

plain white tee   
plain white tee   
damn i look good in my plain white tee   
some of these cats be flossin gucci   
but we gon' be fine in a plain white tee   

plain white tee   
plain white tee   
ain’t nobody else looking fly like me   
and when i buy 5, get another one free   
cuz ain’t no better deal than a…
