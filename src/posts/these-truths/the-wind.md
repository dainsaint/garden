_to breathe_

i once believed  
i could control the wind  


when i was a boy  
i put out my hand  
the wind took it in hers  
and we ran wild together  


when i ran she would  
  fill the kite of my back  
when i leapt she would  
  make gravity a suggestion  
when i cried she would  
  turn it to rain  


at home  
the yelling was bad  
but the silence was worse  
so when i needed to escape  
i would climb my favourite tree  
where i could dance with her in the branches  
falling upwards into her deepest sky  

the wind whispered in my ear  
  and told me where to go  
i whispered back to her  
  and told her where she had sent me  


she was angry one day  
i saw how she darkened the sky  
but there was no room in our house  
for her emotions  
  i had to lock her out  
    i had no choice  
her tears poured and  
my hand reached out and  
the window was in reach and  
the hairs on my body stood on end and  

her  

    lightning  

        struck  

she punched me in the chest with thunder  
knocked the wind right out of me  
knocked me clean away from where  
her sorrow could hurt me

i understood  
it wasn't the first time someone had  
hit me  
  to protect me  
hit me  
  to teach me  
hit me  
  to control me  

my voice had been so small  
i thought if i could hear the wind  
in the smallest whisper  
i shouldnt have to raise my voice  
to be heard  
but no one could hear her  
and so  
no one could hear me  


so when she struck me  
i knew she controlled me  
and i knew  
i had no one  
left  


i had to protect myself  
i knew she owned me  
had signed her name on my windpipe  
so i voided our contract  
twisted my throat shut  
and watched in the mirror  
  as my vision  
    went  
      black

i still dont remember waking up  
she had blown the memory away  
she didnt want me to know  
it was she who had saved me  
even though the howl she left  
where a memory had been      
could only be hers  

but now I knew  
  she had made a home in my lungs  
but now i knew  
  she needed me more than i needed her  
but now i knew  
  she loved me more than i loved myself  
but now i knew  
  that _i_ controlled _her_  


i was powerful  
i would play my music  
  and she would dance for _me_  
i would grab her hand  
  and pull her to where _i_ wanted to go  
when she opened her sky in rage  
i would stand firm  
  and bathe  
  in her tears  

i knew was undeserving  
  _why did i say __control___?  
i knew was uncivilized  
  _why did i say __her___?  

i feared that a grown man who believed he could  
control the winds  
would be controlled himself  
locked in a padded cell  
so far away from the wind  
that a window would appear  
a tombstone  

i had seen how this world treats  
those who can touch the spirits  
the only spirits we are allowed to touch  
are stuffed into a bottle  
and poured out  
wish by wish  

i had to let her go  
  so _she_ became _it_  
became nothing more than a  
  high pressure system  
life became nothing more than a  
  high pressure system  
these checks  
and bills  
and debts  
and wills  
and friends  
and lovers  
became nothing more than a  
  high pressure system  

sometimes we would pass each other  
in the street  
i would see her playing  
  in a corner  
making dna spirals out of dead leaves  
  making life out of death  
while i was  
  living life out of breath  

drowning in a sea of oxygen  
dying of thirst for want of a glass  

without her i had to learn how to breathe on my own  
when all i ever wanted  
was to fall upwards  
once more  
into her  
endless  
sky

last week i saw her in the park  
she was playing with a child's balloon  
caressing a child's face  
tossing a child's hair  
and before i could stop myself  
i said  
hello  

she looked up and  
she smiled and  
she ran over to me and  
she held me and  
she kissed me and  
she said  
_i've missed you_  
and i finally realised  

i never controlled the wind  
  the wind never controlled me  
it was never about control  
  in the first place
