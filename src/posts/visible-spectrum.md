the visible spectrum is a mere sliver  
the silver on the back of the glass  
that reflects our entire existence

but it is still only a sliver

> 

my reds pulse deep bloody heat  
the anger of injustice and  
the passion of existing regardless and  
you will never see my infrared  
but you will feel it all the same

> 

my violets radiate high spirit light  
the knowledge of my history and  
the compassion of my future and  
you will never see my ultraviolet  
but it will burn you all the same

> 

my mother knit my black skin from starstuff  
in a basement apartment  
that had no room for her dreams  
(so she placed them in me)

she gave me gemini  
the night sky that pulses with  
x-ray and gamma and  
microwave and potential energy  
and said _all this can be yours  
i gave you eyes to see  
but they are not your vision_

> 

to think i spent years wearing only black  
because they made no dye for   
the colours i saw every time  
i closed my eyes

> 

my greens spread, earth-driven vines  
the love of being alive and  
the yearning to hold you all and  
you will never taste my chlorophyll  
but it will feed you all the same
