<p>&quot;I'm not sure I understand.&quot;</p>
<p>Perry smiles and takes a deep breath. &quot;I know I have forever to explain this to you, Quentin,&quot; he says, &quot;but I'd rather not take it.&quot;</p>
<p>Quentin chuckles as the pair look out on the fractured landscape, great glaciers of obsidian glass undulating as would the pistons of a great engine. &quot;I don't mean to be daft, just having a bit of a hard time with the concept. Where is this place?&quot;
Perry shakes his head. &quot;You're still using the wrong adverbs, chap. You are not in a place, you are at a time. Or an untime, rather.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well how did I get here? Or, now, I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it would be obvious. You've time travelled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you said that eariler, and I maintain that the thought is just as ridiculous as when I first heard it. I am not a scientist --&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well that much is apparent,&quot; interrupts Percy.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes well, glibness aside, that merely proves my point. If I am having such a hard time fathoming what has taken place, how can I possibly have the wherewithal to travel through time itself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's a rather good point,&quot; says Percy, thoughtfully tapping his pipe against the heel of his shoe. &quot;perhaps you hit your head on the way in and have forgotten you were a brilliant astrophysicist. Or instead got incredibly drunk and fell into a passing wormhole.&quot;</p>
<p>Quentin pretends to contemplate this for a moment.
&quot;Untime?&quot; he continues.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Well you know time travel is impossible, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you said--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And this is when impossible things go.&quot;</p>
<p>Quentin lets the grammar of that sentence wash over him as a flock of sparrows bursts fully formed from a rotted apple in the distance.</p>
