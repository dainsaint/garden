A boy was bitten by a spider  
The venom was paralyzing  
His therapist recommended yoga and dance  
Heâ€™s now more flexible than ever before  

A boy was blinded by an accident  
Noises became too much, but his faith gives him strength  
His father sued the truck company for negligence  
He just got into law school  

A woman feels invisible  
Her brother is temperamental, her husband stretched too thin  
Their closest friend pretends to be stoic to hide his depression  
But together, they are still a family  

A boy was adopted by American parents  
His foreign roots gave him perspective  
He loves this country  
He works as a journalist, now  

A boy lost his parents to crime  
He used his inheritance to found youth centers  
He feels much better, now  
But at night, the bats still haunt his dreams
