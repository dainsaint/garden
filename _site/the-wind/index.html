      <p><strong>1.</strong><br>
the word <em>spirit</em><br>
means<br>
<em>to breathe</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>2.</strong><br>
i once believed<br>
i could control the wind</p>
<p>when i was a boy<br>
i put out my hand<br>
the wind took it in hers<br>
and we ran wild together</p>
<p>when i ran she would<br>
  fill the kite of my back<br>
when i leapt she would<br>
  make gravity a suggestion<br>
when i cried she would<br>
  turn it to rain</p>
<p>at home<br>
the yelling was bad<br>
but the silence was worse<br>
so when i needed to escape<br>
i would climb my favourite tree<br>
where i could dance with her in the branches<br>
falling upwards into her deepest sky</p>
<p>the wind whispered in my ear<br>
  and told me where to go<br>
i whispered back to her<br>
  and told her where she had sent me</p>
<p>she was angry one day<br>
i saw how she darkened the sky<br>
but there was no room in our house<br>
for her emotions<br>
  i had to lock her out<br>
    i had no choice<br>
her tears poured and<br>
my hand reached out and<br>
the window was in reach and<br>
the hairs on my body stood on end and</p>
<p>her</p>
<p>lightning</p>
<p>struck</p>
<p>she punched me in the chest with thunder<br>
knocked the wind right out of me<br>
knocked me clean away from where<br>
her sorrow could hurt me</p>
<p>i understood<br>
it wasn't the first time someone had<br>
hit me<br>
  to protect me<br>
hit me<br>
  to teach me<br>
hit me<br>
  to control me</p>
<p>my voice had been so small<br>
i thought if i could hear the wind<br>
in the smallest whisper<br>
i shouldnt have to raise my voice<br>
to be heard<br>
but no one could hear her<br>
and so<br>
no one could hear me</p>
<p>so when she struck me<br>
i knew she controlled me<br>
and i knew<br>
i had no one<br>
left</p>
<p>i had to protect myself<br>
i knew she owned me<br>
had signed her name on my windpipe<br>
so i voided our contract<br>
twisted my throat shut<br>
and watched in the mirror<br>
  as my vision<br>
    went<br>
      black</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>3.</strong><br>
i still dont remember waking up<br>
she had blown the memory away<br>
she didnt want me to know<br>
it was she who had saved me<br>
even though the howl she left<br>
where a memory had been<br>
could only be hers</p>
<p>but now I knew<br>
  she had made a home in my lungs<br>
but now i knew<br>
  she needed me more than i needed her<br>
but now i knew<br>
  she loved me more than i loved myself<br>
but now i knew<br>
  that <em>i</em> controlled <em>her</em></p>
<p>i was powerful<br>
i would play my music<br>
  and she would dance for <em>me</em><br>
i would grab her hand<br>
  and pull her to where <em>i</em> wanted to go<br>
when she opened her sky in rage<br>
i would stand firm<br>
  and bathe<br>
  in her tears</p>
<p>i knew was undeserving<br>
  <em>why did i say <strong>control</strong></em>?<br>
i knew was uncivilized<br>
  <em>why did i say <strong>her</strong></em>?</p>
<p>i feared that a grown man who believed he could<br>
control the winds<br>
would be controlled himself<br>
locked in a padded cell<br>
so far away from the wind<br>
that a window would appear<br>
a tombstone</p>
<p>i had seen how this world treats<br>
those who can touch the spirits<br>
the only spirits we are allowed to touch<br>
are stuffed into a bottle<br>
and poured out<br>
wish by wish</p>
<p>i had to let her go<br>
  so <em>she</em> became <em>it</em><br>
became nothing more than a<br>
  high pressure system<br>
life became nothing more than a<br>
  high pressure system<br>
these checks<br>
and bills<br>
and debts<br>
and wills<br>
and friends<br>
and lovers<br>
became nothing more than a<br>
  high pressure system</p>
<p>sometimes we would pass each other<br>
in the street<br>
i would see her playing<br>
  in a corner<br>
making dna spirals out of dead leaves<br>
  making life out of death<br>
while i was<br>
  living life out of breath</p>
<p>drowning in a sea of oxygen<br>
dying of thirst for want of a glass</p>
<p>without her i had to learn how to breathe on my own<br>
when all i ever wanted<br>
was to fall upwards<br>
once more<br>
into her<br>
endless<br>
sky</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>4.</strong><br>
last week i saw her in the park<br>
she was playing with a child's balloon<br>
caressing a child's face<br>
tossing a child's hair<br>
and before i could stop myself<br>
i said<br>
hello</p>
<p>she looked up and<br>
she smiled and<br>
she ran over to me and<br>
she held me and<br>
she kissed me and<br>
she said<br>
<em>i've missed you</em><br>
and i finally realised</p>
<p>i never controlled the wind<br>
  the wind never controlled me<br>
it was never about control<br>
  in the first place</p>
