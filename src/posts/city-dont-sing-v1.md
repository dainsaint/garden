see them walking, yeah  
don’t have nowhere to go  
see them talking, yeah  
how long  
they say we could never know

and my heart breaks for the people  
that need other people  
can’t get through life alone

and my heart breaks for the people  
when the city don’t sing no more

>

see them struggle, yeah  
can’t seem to pay the bills  
see them hustle, yeah  
survive every day  
on the strength of will

and my heart waits for the people  
that help other people  
get through this life alone

and my heart waits  
but the city don’t sing no more

>

_laad di trouble jussa pile up pon wi_  
_laad di struggle jussa style up pon wi_  
_laad di trouble jussa pile up pon wi_  
_laad di struggle jussa style up pon wi_  

_but still wi a wait_  
_still wi a wait_  
_still wi a wait for salvation_  

>

and my heart waits for the people  
that help other people  
to get through life alone

and my heart breaks  

but the city don’t sing no more
